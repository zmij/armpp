# armpp

**armpp** is a low-level C++ library designed to simplify the process of 
working with ARM32 hardware. The library is designed to replace traditional
C code with more readable and equally efficient C++ code, providing an
easier way to access and manipulate hardware via user-friendly C++ interfaces.

## Features
The armpp library provides an assortment of classes that allow developers
to interact with ARM32 hardware more conveniently. It's designed to be
compatible with most ARM32 Cortex-M based Microcontrollers (MCUs).

However, it's currently being tested on an ARM32 Cortex-M3 core in a 
Gowin GW1NSR-4C FPGA development board TangNano 4K.

## Prerequisites
To use the library, you will need to have the arm-none-eabi toolkit installed. 
I'm currently working on adding support for the clang toolkit. The library is
built using cmake, and instructions for building from source will be provided later.

## Getting Started
Examples and usage guidelines are currently under development and will be added in the future.

## Building the Library
The armpp library can be compiled from the source using cmake.

Detailed build instructions will be provided soon.

## Known Issues
Currently, the library is only compatible with the arm-none-eabi toolkit.
We are actively working on adding support for the clang toolkit.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! We are currently developing guidelines for contributing,
but if you're eager to contribute, feel free to create a pull request.
